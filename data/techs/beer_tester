Beer tester
The beer tester checks the purity of the beer. He pours beer onto a bench and then sits on it. If, after one hour, his trousers stick to the bench, it means the beer contains sugar and is bad beer. Testing the beer will reduce illness among your workers and will therefore increase stone, wood and ore production.
