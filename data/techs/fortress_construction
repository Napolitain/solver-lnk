Fortress construction
You have the option of merging fully upgraded castles and constructing a mighty fortress from them. Fortresses allow you to construct new buildings, explore new research and offer more space for both resources and units. You can also improve your soldiers training and improve your defences, making your fortress an almost insurmountable obstacle for your enemies.
