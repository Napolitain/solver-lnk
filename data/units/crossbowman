With these advanced crossbows, your archers can shoot further and more precisely than with bows. Protected behind the walls of castle fortifications, they can effectively halt advancing troops from a distance. However, the long time required to tense the crossbow makes them vulnerable in unprotected terrain, so crossbowmen are generally deployed to defend your own castle.
